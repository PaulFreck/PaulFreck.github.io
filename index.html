            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Computer Science. This website is meant to host some of the things I have done as well as <a href="Paul_Freck_Resume.pdf">My Resume</a></p>
            <h2>My Most Recent Project:</h2>
            <p><a href="Suricata.html">My most recent project. It involved taking recent attacks and detecting them through their network signatures.</a></p>
            <p><a href="rockgame.html">A very unfinished Rock Game.</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/PaulFreck/RoleManager">Role Manager Bot:</a> This Discord Bot has functionality like adding, and deleting roles from users as well as archiving threads that have been active for too long. The bot also allowed users to add time before a thread was archieved.</p>
            <h2>Clubs and Organizations:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://csec.cs.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison Cybersecurity Club</a> - member</li>
                <li><a href="https://wa.wisc.edu/">Wisconsin Autonomous</a> - Infrastructure Developer</li>
                <p>As an Infrastructure developer, I have contributed to the V2X challenge, in which I took messages from the world and transported them to the brains of our car to transform into actionable data.</data></p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Target Seasonal Tech Specialist</li>
                <ul>
                    <il>I was hired to a fast paced retail environment where I setup systems in order to respond to customer needs and worked with security to quickly resolve security incidents.</il>
                </ul>
                <li>Hudson Valley Credit Union Summer Intern</li>
                <ul>
                    <il>I was selected as one of eight candidates from over forty applicants to participate in an internship program. During this program I shadowed positions in various credit unions departments and delivered presentations of an intern’s perspective on the company’s branches and policies to executives, department leaders, and program coordinators. </il>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2>Coursework</h2>
            <ul>
                <il>Introduction To Information Security: "Senior level undergraduate course covering various topics on information security. Covers a wide range of topics, such as cryptographic primitives, security protocols, system security, and emerging topics"</il>
                <li>Programming III: "The third course in our programming fundamentals sequence. It presumes that students understand and use functional and object-oriented design and abstract data types as needed. This course introduces balanced search trees, graphs, graph traversal algorithms, hash tables and sets, and complexity analysis and about classes of problems that require each data type. Students are required to design and implement using high quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions. Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects: inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions, performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks. Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software."</li>
                <il>Machine Organization and Programming: "An introduction to fundamental structures of computer systems and the C programming language with a focus on the low-level interrelationships and impacts on performance. Topics include the virtual address space and virtual memory, the heap and dynamic memory management, the memory hierarchy and caching, assembly language and the stack, communication and interrupts/signals, compiling and assemblers/linkers."</il>
                <li>Topics in Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra (Honors): "Honors Calculus is a year-long sequence of two courses–MATH 375 and 376–which serves as a more theoretical and advanced alternative to multi-variable calculus (MATH 234), differential equations (MATH 319), and linear algebra (MATH 341). The goal of these courses is to provide highly motivated and well-prepared students with an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of these fundamental areas of mathematics. These courses are likely quite different from math courses you have taken before. They focus on the theoretical underpinnings of the subject, including abstract notation, proofs of theorems, basic logic, and difficult problem-solving techniques. It is not uncommon for students to be shocked by the amount of work that these courses take.  However, those that stick with it gain valuable skills that cannot be obtained from our standard (and easier) courses."</li>
                <li>Introduction to Computer Engineering: "Logic components built with transistors, rudimentary Boolean algebra, basic combinational logic design, basic synchronous sequential logic design, basic computer organization and design, introductory machine- and assembly-language programming."</li>
